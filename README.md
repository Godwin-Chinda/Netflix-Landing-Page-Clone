# Netflix Landing Page Clone

This is a responsive Netflix landing page clone built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. It features a hero section with a background image that smoothly fades into the page's background color, mimicking the seamless aesthetic of the official Netflix website.

## Features

- Hero section with background image and overlay gradient
- Smooth image-to-color transition (no sharp cut-off)
- Responsive layout for various screen sizes
- Footer with multiple column links
- Language selector button
- Dark theme with linear gradient background
- JavaScript support for interactivity and future enhancements

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling, gradients, layout with Flexbox
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Interactivity (coming or planned features)


## How It Works

- **Hero Background:** The `.hero` section displays a full-width image.
- **Page Background:** The `body` uses a `linear-gradient` from a reddish brown to black for continuity.
- **Interactivity:** JavaScript is included via `script.js` for dynamic features like form validation, toggle menus, or language selection (customizable as needed).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-landing-clone.git
    cd netflix-landing-clone
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Customization

- Replace the hero image in `assets/images/hero-bg.jpg`.
- Adjust the gradient colors in `style.css` for your brand theme.
- Extend `script.js` to add features like:
  - Form validation
  - Language switching
  - Scroll-based animations
  - Theme toggles
